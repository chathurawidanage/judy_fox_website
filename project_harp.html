            Recent newly designed Big Data processing tools focus on the abstraction of data and related computation
            flows. For example, Hadoop MapReduce defines data as Key-Value pairs and computation as Map-Reduce tasks.
            Pregel/Giraph perceives data as vertices and edges in graphs and computation as BSP iterations. Spark
            abstracts data as RDDs with transformation operations on top of them. However, there is no abstraction of
            communication patterns in these tools. On the other hand, traditional distributed data processing tools,
            represented by MPI, have abstraction of collective communication. But this kind of abstraction is limited
            because it is only based on arrays and buffers. It cannot support complicated data abstractions and related
            communication patterns such as shuffling on Key-Values or graph communication based on edges and vertices.
        </p>
        <p>
            To improve the expressiveness and performance in big data processing, the Harp library is introduced, which
            provides data abstractions and related communication abstractions and transforms map-reduce programming
            models into map-collective models. The word “harp” symbolizes the effort to make parallel processes
            cooperate together through collective communication for efficient data processing, just as strings in a harp
            can make concordant sound. Harp can integrate with Hadoop 1.2.1 and Hadoop 2.2.0. It supports data
            abstraction types such as arrays, key-values, and graphs with related collective communication operations on
            top of each type. Several applications are developed based on Harp framework, including K-means clustering,
            multi-dimensional scaling and PageRank. Being based on Hadoop, Harp has better sustainability and fault
            tolerance properties than Twister or Twister4Azure that inspired it.
