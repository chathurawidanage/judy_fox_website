            Twister4Azure is an iterative MapReduce framework for Azure cloud that extends the MapReduce programming
            model to support data-intensive iterative computations. Twister4Azure enables a wide array of large-scale
            iterative data mining and data analysis applications to utilize the Azure cloud platform in an easy,
            efficient, and fault-tolerant manner. Its architecture utilizes the scalable, distributed, and highly
            available Azure cloud services as the underlying building blocks and employs a decentralized control
            architecture that avoids single point failures. Twister4Azure takes care of almost all the Azure
            infrastructure (service failures, load balancing, etc.) and coordination challenges, and frees users from
            having to deal with the challenges of cloud services. It also implements Map-Collectives high performance
            communication and computation abstractions, supporting Map-AllGather, Map-AllReduce, MapReduceMergeBroadcast
            and Map-ReduceScatter patterns. This work was presented at CCGrid in May 2014 and has pioneered many of the
            Collectives ideas that we are carrying forward on Harp described below.

            To improve the expressiveness and performance in big data processing, the Harp library is introduced, which
            provides data abstractions and related communication abstractions and transforms map-reduce programming
            models into map-collective models. The word “harp” symbolizes the effort to make parallel processes
            cooperate together through collective communication for efficient data processing, just as strings in a harp
            can make concordant sound. Harp can integrate with Hadoop 1.2.1 and Hadoop 2.2.0. It supports data
            abstraction types such as arrays, key-values, and graphs with related collective communication operations on
            top of each type. Several applications are developed based on Harp framework, including K-means clustering,
            multi-dimensional scaling and PageRank. Being based on Hadoop, Harp has better sustainability and fault
            tolerance properties than Twister or Twister4Azure that inspired it.
